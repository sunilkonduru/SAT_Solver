Boolean Satisfiability(SAT Solver)

- Have implemented the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form.
- Implemented Unit Propagation, Pure Literal Elimination and MOM heuristic(Maximum number of Occurences (variables) in the Minimum length(clauses)) for improving the performance of the algorithm.
